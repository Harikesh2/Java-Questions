# JAVASCRIPT AND CLASSES

Classes in JavaScript are syntactical sugar over prototypes and provide a more readable and structured way to work with object-oriented programming concepts.



# OOPS

OOPS is programming paradigm which is used to solve a problem!!


## Object 
-- collection of properties and methods
-- Ex:- toLowerCase 

## Why use OOPS ?
 Code is getting mesh-up in js so that's the reason we have oops !!

 ## Parts of OOPS
Object Literal:- 

-- Constractor Function 
-- Prototype
--Classes
--Instances (new, this)

# 4 pillars of Oops
-- Abstraction - hiding details of something like Fetch
-- Encapsulation- Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. 
-- Inheritance -  that allows a new class to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods and fields) of an existing class. 
-- Polymorphism - one thing can do many things
